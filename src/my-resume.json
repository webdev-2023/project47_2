He was key in introducing agile to his organisation and also played a big role in helping team members getting on board with agile. I have found that as a project manager Mukul doesn't shy away from the technical details when facing a difficult problem and thus deservedly commanded respect from all members of the team. Always switched on and easy to get along, Mukul was very effective in coordinating all the stake holders, including offshore teams, and thus was instrumental in delivering the project on time, against very challenging schedule. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mukul and given the chance, would love to work with him again."
